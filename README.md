# chatgpt-discord-bot
Bot linking Discord and ChatGPT.
This is the Python implementation of a Discord bot that accesses a ChatGPT account and fetches responses in a private server. The code is not fully mine - I learnt to make this bot in a Geeks-For-Geeks event held in my institute. Some information like the ChatGPT API Key and my Discord server ID have been removed to facilitate a universality in the code - anyone can replace those values and make the bot run in their own unique ways.

The bot is to be inserted into the private server before implementation.

Please run main.py first to make sure the bot is active before opening the server and trying to start the bot.
